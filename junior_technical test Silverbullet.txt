Create a HTTP web application in python
The application should accept a request containing a sentence (in english)
The application should respond with the nouns contained within the sentence

The web application does not require a user interface - a REST API or similar is a valid submission.
You can use any 3rd party python packages to complete this task.

Please include a readme with your code with instructions to run it locally.
Please host your code in a public github repo.
